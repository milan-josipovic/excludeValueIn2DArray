Imagine we have a zookeeper who is supposed to clean the first leopard in each of four stables but skip stable b entirely and also he needs to skip second and third leopard in other stables.

Then he needs to skip second leopard in all the stables and also skip stable b entirely.

At last he needs to clean all the stables and all the leopards.

Use countinue with/out label.
